# UI-UX-Experiment5

## Aim:
To Present 2 different UX project scenarios

## Algorithm
## 1. Identifying & Writing UX Problem Statements
## A. MEDIHELP (Online Doctor Consultation & Medicine Booking App)
## User Pain Points

Users find it difficult to choose the right doctor due to lack of clear experience details.
Video consultations get disconnected due to poor UI feedback.
Prescription history is hard to access quickly.
Elderly users struggle with booking appointment slots.
Medicine delivery status is confusing and not updated in real time.

## UX Problem Statements

"Patients need a way to easily identify the right doctor because unclear information leads to wrong choices and booking mistakes."
"Elderly users need a simple and guided appointment booking process because the current slot selection screen is confusing, resulting in failed or delayed bookings."

## B. EDUHUB (Online Learning Platform – Courses & Live Classes)
## User Pain Points

Course recommendations are irrelevant and overwhelming.
Students cannot download notes easily.
Live class joining process takes too many steps.
Progress tracking is unclear and hidden inside multiple menus.
Too many notifications for assignments create stress.

## UX Problem Statements

"Learners need a way to track course progress clearly because hidden progress data reduces motivation and causes confusion."
"Students need a simpler way to join live classes because the current multi-step process wastes time and causes them to miss sessions."

## 2. Identifying Appropriate Research Methods
## A. MEDIHELP – Suitable Research Methods
## User Interviews

To understand patient struggles, doctor selection behaviour, and concerns about online consultation.

## Contextual Inquiry

Observe how elderly users or new patients book appointments.

## Usability Testing

Test video call flow, appointment booking, and prescription access.

## Justification

Since MEDIHELP deals with sensitive health interactions, direct conversations + real-world observation help reveal trust issues, navigation problems, and clarity needs.

## B. EDUHUB – Suitable Research Methods
## Surveys

To collect data on course preferences, device usage, and learning patterns.

## A/B Testing

Compare two versions of the “Join Class” button or course recommendation layout.

## Heatmaps

To study where students click most on dashboards.

## Justification

EDUHUB is used by thousands of students daily → Large-scale data methods (surveys, heatmaps, A/B tests) help optimize learning flow and navigation effectively.
